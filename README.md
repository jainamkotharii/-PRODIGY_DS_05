# PRODIGY_DS_05

• Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

• Here's my submission for Task 5 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I performed an in-depth analysis of traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and aimed to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is [Road Traffic Accident (RTA) Dataset](RTA Dataset.csv) which is uploaded in this repository. This dataset contains records of traffic accidents, with the following columns: 'Time', 'Day_of_week', 'Age_band_of_driver', 'Sex_of_driver', 'Educational_level', 'Vehicle_driver_relation', 'Driving_experience', 'Type_of_vehicle', 'Owner_of_vehicle', 'Service_year_of_vehicle', 'Defect_of_vehicle', 'Area_accident_occured', 'Lanes_or_Medians', 'Road_allignment', 'Types_of_Junction', 'Road_surface_type', 'Road_surface_conditions', 'Light_conditions', 'Weather_conditions', 'Type_of_collision', 'Number_of_vehicles_involved', 'Number_of_casualties', 'Vehicle_movement', 'Casualty_class', 'Sex_of_casualty', 'Age_band_of_casualty', 'Casualty_severity', 'Work_of_casuality', 'Fitness_of_casuality', 'Pedestrian_movement', 'Cause_of_accident', 'Accident_severity'.

## Tools and Libraries used

1. Jupyter notebook
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn for visualization

## Traffic Accident Analysis and Visualization

Here's how I conducted the analysis:

• Data Loading and Initial Exploration: Loaded the RTA Dataset.csv and performed initial checks for its structure and data types.

• Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Rigorously checked for and managed missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure data integrity. This also involved converting relevant columns to appropriate data types (e.g., datetime objects for time-related analysis).

• Pattern Identification: Analyzed relationships between accident occurrences and various factors:
• Road Conditions: Explored how different 'Road_surface_type', 'Road_surface_conditions', and 'Road_allignment' contribute to accidents.
• Weather Conditions: Investigated the impact of 'Weather_conditions' on accident frequency and severity.
• Time of Day: Identified patterns in accident occurrences across different 'Time' and 'Day_of_week' periods, helping to pinpoint high-risk periods.

• Visualization of Contributing Factors:
• Generated various plots (e.g., bar charts, line plots, heatmaps) to visualize the distributions of accidents across different road conditions, weather types, and time slots.
• (Conceptual) If more granular location data were available, a heat map or scatter plot to visualize accident hotspots could be created.

## Conclusion

• To summarize, this analysis of traffic accident data successfully identified key patterns and contributing factors related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Through thorough data cleaning and insightful visualizations, a clearer understanding of accident dynamics has been established. This work provides valuable insights for road safety initiatives, allowing for targeted interventions to reduce accidents and improve overall road safety.
